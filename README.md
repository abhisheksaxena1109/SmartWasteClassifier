# SmartWasteClassifier

• IoT-based smart waste classifier system that classifies waste items using YOLOv8 trained on a self-designed dataset
consisting of more than 8000 images into 6 categories - paper, plastic, metal, organic, cardboard, and glass.
• RaspberryPi is installed inside dustbins, which captures the picture of the waste item, then the deployed YOLO model
identifies it, and then transfers the item to its corresponding waste compartment using a Servo Motor.
• A web-based interface is made available to the public for their convenience.
